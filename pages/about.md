# **About Me**
<br>
Hi, I'm **{{ site.author.name }}** :wave:,<br>
<br>
I'm a Japanese-English bilingual with a background in psychological research, data analysis, and information technology. I'm passionate about solving real-world problems with practical solutions -- whether that be untangling datasets to find explanations, integrating systems to automate processes, or fixing a bug in my experiment code. Take a look at some of my projects <a href="/projects">here</a>!<br>
<br>
You can download a <a href="/assets/EB_CV.pdf" target="_blank">PDF of my academic & research CV</a> and my <a href="/assets/EmikoBellResume2023.pdf">current resume</a>. <br>

A complete list of my experience is on my <a href="https://linkedin.com/in/emikobell/" target="_blank">LinkedIn page</a>.
