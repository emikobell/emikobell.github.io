# **About Me**
<br>
Hello, I'm **{{ site.author.name }}**.<br>
<br>
I'm a Japanese-English bilingual software engineer with a background in psychological research, data analysis, and information technology. I'm passionate about solving real-world problems with practical solutions -- whether that be untangling datasets to find explanations, integrating systems to automate processes, or developing a feature to automate manual tasks. Take a look at some of my projects <a href="/projects">here</a>!<br>
