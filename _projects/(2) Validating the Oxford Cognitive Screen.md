Research and validated measures of executive function (EF) in low- to middle-income countries (LMIC) are minimal compared to high-income countries, with even less of a focus on adolescent EF. Currently, a widely validated measure of EF is unavailable in LMICs to our knowledge, limiting further research on EF and the development of potential interventions.

This study aimed to fill this research gap by establishing a feasibly administered EF assessment through cultural validation. We examined the validity of the Oxford Cognitive Screen -- Executive Function (OCS-EF) and the Rapid Assessment of Cognitive and Emotional Regulation (RACER) as a combined EF assessment for use among Peruvian adolescents (N = 223).

We examined construct validity using confirmatory and exploratory factor analyses and compared three-factor, two-factor, and unitary EF models, and we examined criterion validity using linear mixed models to establish whether the assessment negatively predicted attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) scores using the Swanson, Nolan, and Pelham Teacher and Parent Rating Scale. The construct validity analyses revealed a one-factor model fit in line with previous research among LMIC adults. However, internal reliability measures indicated that the assessment tasks did not account for the majority of the variability in the latent factor. The criterion validity findings indicated that the OCS-EF and RACER did not significantly predict ADHD subscores. We recommend adaptations to the assessment and further research in LMIC contexts to establish OCS-EF and RACER as a valid measure of EF among LMIC adolescents.
