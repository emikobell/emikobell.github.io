Strong, secure relationship with caregivers can be a source of tremendous resilience for youth, particularly those residing in high-risk contexts. Adolescents with greater security in their primary relationships may be able to rely upon internalized security with their caregiver as a psychological reservoir that can protect them against other forms of environmental adversity (Bachman, 1970; Fraley, Heffernan, Vicary, & Brumbaugh, 2011; Papini, Roggman, & Anderson, 1991). 

For instance, adolescents who have low levels of hope that their circumstances have change may be at heightened risk for maladjustment. Indeed, studies demonstrate that youth with low levels of hope are at increased risk for anxiety and depression (Esteves, Scoloveno, Mahat, Yarcheski, & Scoloveno, 2013). However, those adolescents with low hope who have a greater sense of security in their relationship with their primary caregiver may be protected from the negative association between low levels of hope and internalizing distress (depression and anxiety). To date, the majority of the studies examining hope, attachment insecurity and psychological health use predominantly middle-class Caucasian samples and thus, the findings cannot be generalized across cultures and socioeconomic groups. The current study addresses this gap in the literature by examining the interactive associations among hope, attachment insecurity, and internalizing symptoms in low-income, Latinx adolescents, an underrepresented sample. 

As part of an ongoing study evaluating a psychosocial, attachment-based intervention, a sample of low-income, Latinx adolescents (N = 119; 52.1% male; MAge = 12.92) self-reported on their maternal attachment insecurity (Experiences in Close Relationships Scale-Revised, Fraley et al., 2011), hope (Children‚Äôs Hope Scale, Snyder et al., 1997), and internalizing symptoms (Youth Self Report, Achenbach, 1991). In accordance with previous literature, we found that when controlling for age, sex, and years spent in Santa Ana, higher levels of hope predicted lower levels of internalizing symptoms (ùö´<i>R</i><sup>2</sup> = .09, <i>p</i> < .001, <i>b</i>  = -.54, <i>SE</i> = .16), and higher levels of maternal attachment insecurity predicted higher levels of internalizing symptoms (ùö´<i>R</i><sup>2</sup> = .17, <i>p</i> < .001, Anxiety: <i>b</i>  = 11.87, <i>SE</i> = 3.4,  <i>p</i> < .001, Avoidance: <i>b</i>  = 1.66, <i>SE</i> = .63, <i>p</i> < .01). 

While moderating effects were not found for maternal attachment avoidance, maternal attachment anxiety significantly moderated the association between hope and internalizing symptoms (ùö´<i>R</i><sup>2</sup> = .03, <i>p</i> < .05; see Figure 1). Only at mean and high levels of youths‚Äô attachment anxiety was there a negative association between hope and internalizing symptoms. For adolescents reporting low levels of attachment anxiety to their mothers, hope was not associated with internalizing symptoms. This may suggest that having a stronger attachment relationship (lower attachment anxiety) may act as a buffer against psychological distress.
